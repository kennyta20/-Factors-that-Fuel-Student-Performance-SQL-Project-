# Factors that Fuel Student Performance SQL Project
In this intermediate SQL project, I analyzed a student performance database to identify the factors that most influence academic success. Using SQL queries, I explored how variables such as study time, sleep, extracurricular activity participation, attendance, and parental involvement impact test scores. The goal was to generate actionable insights that would help students, teachers, and educational leaders make data-driven decisions to improve student performance. This project highlights the power of data analytics to understand and transform the educational environment.
